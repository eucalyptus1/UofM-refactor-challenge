# Refactor Challenge

## Summary
The purpose of this challenge was to refactor the existing code of a web page to make it more accessible through search engine optimization and to consolidate code where needed, as well as general bug fixes.

## Fixes
Nav bar links were given appropriate IDs to link to their corresponding articles.
CSS for the main two sections of the page was consolidated and unnecessary code was deleted, leaving a much neater style sheet.
CSS styles for each element were arranged in sequential order according to the page for quick reference.
HTML and CSS files were commented to identify each code block's respective section.
